# Growth Engineer Code Discussion

## Introduction

This codebase represents a portion of our website built using NextJS. Like any marketing website, it is essential for it to be optimized for a variety of factors, including:

- **Web Performance:** Ensuring a seamless user experience is vital. The website should be fast and responsive.
- **Search Engines:** A website's discoverability can be greatly improved by taking search engines into consideration (SEO).
- **User Conversion:** Elements such as CTAs, links, and the overall structure play a significant role in converting a casual visitor into a potential lead.
- **Other considerations:** The responsibilities described in the job posting point to other factors that can be taken into account.

Over time, some modifications and updates have been made to this website, potentially impacting some of the factors mentioned above.

## Before the interview

Review the code and the hosted preview, keeping the above factors in mind. Your objective is to understand and analyze how the current code aligns with these optimization goals.

You can access the live preview of the website here: https://growth-engineer-interview-2wqvgg8k0-kalino.vercel.app

Consider utilizing tools such as PageSpeed Insights, or any other tools you find appropriate, to get a holistic view of the site's performance and other relevant metrics.

**Note:** You are not required to make any modifications to the code. The focus is on understanding, analysis, and discussions around potential improvements.

## During the interview

During our interview:

- Share your observations about the code.
- Highlight any potential areas of concern or improvement.
- Provide suggestions or best practices that could enhance the website further, keeping the optimization factors in mind.

Remember, this exercise isn't about getting everything "right". It's more about understanding your analytical process, technical depth, and how you approach these types of challenges.

We're looking forward to your insights and our technical discussion. Thank you for participating in this exercise!

## Running the code

This is not required but if you would like to run the code yourself, you can follow the instructions below.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
